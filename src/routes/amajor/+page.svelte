  <h1>A Major</h1>
  <p>
    A  major  part  of  the  allure  here  is  connecting  those  without  resources,  with  resources. 
    My closest friend in LoDo, Doug, passed with stage 4 Glio. I was next to him at Venice 
    when his left first tremored eating a Caesar. (So did my lovely ortho at Wynkoop Dental; 
    shot  to  my  mental  dome  and  mouth).  His  brother  has  the  willpower,  knowledge,  and 
    resources  (space  tourism  pioneer;  we  argued,  once)  to  keep  his  brother  alive  for  13 
    months  when  the  (since  fired  into  the  heart  of  the  Sun,  and  several  other  stars) 
    oncologists at Swedish wanted to &c. Doug had half of his frontal lobe excised; one flew 
    over  the  Prairie  Dogâ€™s  nest.  But.  He  was  able  to  pass  on  his  own  terms  with  his  own 
    God. Doug and I bonded over Jobs to be Done and Extreme Ownership and the War of 
    the Flea and John Cage the Elder and the Old Testament and the New Testament and a 
    Newer  Testament  and  general  audiophila.  Doug  would  have  told  Steve  Jobs  exactly 
    where to shove it. He probably did, actually.

    <p>Thank  you,  team,  for  listening  to  my  Theodore  Talk.  Temporal  and  mild  frontal  lobe 
    damage also grants you temporal and mild verbal diarrhea. Hence, speeches with gutshot 
    in my gutshit.</p>

    <p>I will still blink symphonies, still.</p>
